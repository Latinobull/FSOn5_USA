/*
 * Overview
 * You are a junior developer that was given an array that is not accurate. There shouldn't be any numbers that is lower that 1, and no number
 *greater than 100. We want to find to get the average of all the numbers without all of the dirty data in our array.
 
  TODO
  Given the parameter 'arr' in the function, remove any numbers that is lower than 1 and greater than 100. Then given the new cleaned array,
  Add up all the numbers together and divide them by the amount of items in the clean arr.
  Return that final number rounded down so we don't get any decimal numbers
 
 ? Criteria
 ? No plain for loops, that includes of and in loops
 ? You have to use the iteration methods learned last class ex(map(), filter(), find(), every(), some(), reduce() etc)
